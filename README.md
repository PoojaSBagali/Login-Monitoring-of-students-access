An login portal system developed in C that manages student access to websites. Students can login securely and access allowed websites or receive warnings for blocked sites. After two warnings, student accounts are automatically locked. Administrators have full control to add, update, and delete students, manage allowed and blocked website lists, and view a complete activity history.
